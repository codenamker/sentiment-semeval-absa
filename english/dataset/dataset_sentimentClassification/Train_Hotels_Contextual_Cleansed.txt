a great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.
oh my goodness-i am not a happy camper.
my hp is very heavy.
not easy to carry.
the battery has never worked well.
the battery has never worked well.
the battery gets so hot it is scary.
yet, hp won't do anything about the problem.
i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for 3 months.
when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.
so, you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item.
currently if i use the laptop i can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs.
well, they don't care a bunch.
but, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem.
i would â say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.
and, if you are going to deal with hp be careful.
in my house, hp is a nasty word.
since i purchased my toshiba netbook, i have been very pleased with it, i have a laptob and a desktop.

this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
the dvd burner broke after burning 3 dvd'd during that time!
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before!
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person!
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up!
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase!

this just keeps having it's hard drive replaced!
acer won't replace the laptop.
the manufacturer's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts.
this thing is a lemon.

it took toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.
then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
being only 2 months old, i am not a happy camper!
buyer beware.
this one, in my opinion, might be a lemon!

toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and i am not kidding you, i called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
it's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.
and at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (i bought the memory stick they recomended).
long story short, since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one, i didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.

i'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba.

the mouse is a little bit different than what you're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly.

overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.

i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat.
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told, was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.

english must have been his third or fourth language.
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test, and it was failing.
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me.
after 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.
after they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don't allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn't be covered.
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service.

in the past four years i've had it i have never once gotten a virus.
i did have to replace the battery once, but that was only a couple months ago and it's been working perfect ever since.

so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.

this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop (my wife and i have another laptop), or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks.
i use this for my tutoring business, and since i'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).

the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba.
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue.
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to louisville ky.
and toshiba is totally unconcerned.
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.
we don't mind and you don't matter.
i would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter.

my one complaint with this laptop is that i've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and i'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but i still expected better product quality for this price range.

the statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.
the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.
enabling the battery timer is useless.
the "time remaining" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.
it's so bad that i'm thinking i only got half a battery or something.
i know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot.:-)
if you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.

it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required.
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in.
this is an over-sized, 18-inch laptop.
it wouldn't fit in most 17-inch bags.
i was disappointed when i realized that the keyboard doesn't light up on this model.
it also does not have bluetooth.
you'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them.
i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing, i took it for granted that these features were standard.
overall, still a very nice machine.
boots up fast and runs great!

purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.
i thought learning the mac os would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc.
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing.
the only time i have restarted is during system updates.
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one.

took it back as it was defective.
page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something.
couldn't keep a page up you were working on!
was a great deal i will give that.
the laptop preformed pretty well.
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once.
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again.
the mouse on the pad, the left button always sticks.

i tried turning it done but it did nothing.

i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased.
so i'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.
i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i won't have to worry about a crash.
i bought this emachines notebook pc in january of this year and i am highlyâ dissatisfied with it.
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning.
it freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it.
i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem.
well, i started using google chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.
another issue i have with it is the battery.
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when i click on it it says: " consider replacing your battery" and it does not hold full charge.

you like thai cuisine 
the worst customer service experience at 
a  gentleman 
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not mcdonald's, every place makes things differently
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
never again!

both wanted cheeseburgers and they

their  burgers  fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them
also they were $15 each!
a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll 
it was $14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-i've had better for less elsewhere!

the  food
this  place  is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant
the last two times i ordered from here my  food  was soo spicy that  i could barely eat it
and the  spice  took away from the flavor of the dish
and the tom kha soup was pathetic 
good authentic thai this place

the  pesto pizza  was excellent
crust pizza with a nice amount of  spicy italian cheese  that i'd never heard of before
conveniently located too, being right on bedford ave.
the  back garden sitting area  is very pleasant
i will definetly be going back.
