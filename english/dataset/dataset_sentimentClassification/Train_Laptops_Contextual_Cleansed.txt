a great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.
oh my goodness-i am not a happy camper.
my hp is very heavy.
not easy to carry.
the battery has never worked well.
the battery has never worked well.
the battery gets so hot it is scary.
yet, hp won't do anything about the problem.
i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for 3 months.
when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.
so, you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item.
currently if i use the laptop i can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs.
well, they don't care a bunch.
but, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem.
i would â say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.
and, if you are going to deal with hp be careful.
in my house, hp is a nasty word.
since i purchased my toshiba netbook, i have been very pleased with it, i have a laptob and a desktop.

this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
the dvd burner broke after burning 3 dvd'd during that time!
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before!
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person!
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up!
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase!

this just keeps having it's hard drive replaced!
acer won't replace the laptop.
the manufacturer's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts.
this thing is a lemon.

it took toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.
then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
being only 2 months old, i am not a happy camper!
buyer beware.
this one, in my opinion, might be a lemon!

toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and i am not kidding you, i called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
it's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.
and at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (i bought the memory stick they recomended).
long story short, since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one, i didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.

i'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba.

the mouse is a little bit different than what you're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly.

overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.

i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat.
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told, was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.

english must have been his third or fourth language.
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test, and it was failing.
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me.
after 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.
after they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don't allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn't be covered.
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service.

in the past four years i've had it i have never once gotten a virus.
i did have to replace the battery once, but that was only a couple months ago and it's been working perfect ever since.

so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.

the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba.
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue.
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to louisville ky.
and toshiba is totally unconcerned.
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.
we don't mind and you don't matter.
i would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter.

my one complaint with this laptop is that i've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and i'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but i still expected better product quality for this price range.

the statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.
the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.
enabling the battery timer is useless.
the "time remaining" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.
it's so bad that i'm thinking i only got half a battery or something.
i know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot.:-)
if you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.

it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required.
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in.
this is an over-sized, 18-inch laptop.
it wouldn't fit in most 17-inch bags.
i was disappointed when i realized that the keyboard doesn't light up on this model.
it also does not have bluetooth.
you'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them.
i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing, i took it for granted that these features were standard.
overall, still a very nice machine.
boots up fast and runs great!

i thought learning the mac os would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc.
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing.
the only time i have restarted is during system updates.
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one.

i like it so much, i bought another just for my wife.
took it back as it was defective.
page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something.
couldn't keep a page up you were working on!
was a great deal i will give that.
the laptop preformed pretty well.
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once.
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again.
the mouse on the pad, the left button always sticks.
the mouse is way way way to sensitve.
i tried turning it done but it did nothing.

i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased.

i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i won't have to worry about a crash.
i bought this emachines notebook pc in january of this year and i am highlyâ dissatisfied with it.
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning.
it freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it.
i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem.
well, i started using google chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.
another issue i have with it is the battery.
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when i click on it it says: " consider replacing your battery" and it does not hold full charge.

i dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing.
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it.
it doesnt work worth a damn.
the display is beyond horrible.
i can not even read what i am writing half of the time.
there are so many things wrong with this product, it just makes me want to set my self on fire!
i would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.
not to mention it has shit gigs.
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage.

in those three years, i've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily.
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership, so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan.

needs constant repair.
first the screen goes completely out.
then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.
now the screen is going darker, darker, darker.
hp is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.

i'v spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand.

no tutorials on the display.

the macbook is a fantastic laptop.
you will love this macbook if you choose to buy it.
the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot.
it just works flawlessly!
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.
i honestly love my mac, thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict.

this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised.
it had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one.
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate.
keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.

when i got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school, i had a hard time from beginning.
i feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plasticâ piecesâ would come off of it.
quite simply this is the best laptop i have ever owned.
for me, five stars is not enough.
i love the 15" macbook pro.
my parents bought it for me as a graduation gift, and i'm totally (almost kind of maybe definitely) obsessed with it.
it was very easy to just pick up and use--
it did not take long to get used to the mac os.
i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for (internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.

there are several programs for school or office use (pages, numbers, keynote, etc.), music (garageband), photo management (photo booth, iphoto), video-editing or movie-making (imovie), etc.
the built-in webcam is great for skype and similar video-chat services.
itunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an ipod.

the key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the macbook pro.

the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it.
i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.

it's color is even cool.
another great thing is the beast graphics.
they are so realistic i am just speechless.
i let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease.
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it.
i don't know how i could ever live without my qousmio.

i'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the 'old' way - and apple does, indeed, have the better idea.
i really wish i had done this years ago.
pairing it with an iphone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it's a snap.
i love it - never had a computer i was so impressed with - and i've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is far and above the best one i ever had before.
i tell everyone that i know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.

so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.
then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.
i had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair.
got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.

it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.
the graphics are great.
the internet speed is spectacular.

this computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.
oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.
i bought a hp pavilion dv4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer.
the computer is so slow, even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up.
they said it was a computer error on this type of computer.
also, i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.
when the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself.
also, the battery does not last very long at all.
i would recommend not buying this product.
i have had no luck with staples or hp to resolve this problem.
i am stuck with a laptop that i cannot do very much with.

i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty.
i sent it back and they lost it.
i waited and waited and no laptop.
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.
i waited another month for approval and for them to "build" me a new laptop.
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn't go onto our wireless network and i wouldn't have the same problems because it was updated.
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.
hp didn't fix it.
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in.

they say sorry out of warranty.
summary: they played games with me for the warranty period.
now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.
they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything.
now the machine won't connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now i'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought the netbook.

i burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so i can place it there.
i had to call apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.
for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an itouch 8gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).
steve jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.
the lesson learned here is: it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.
so i called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, i just chose to hide the message.
also the speakers are not very loud, but it is a netbook.
would highly recommend this netbook though.
i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent.
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork.

called tech support and got the usual acer "we don't support software but for $$$ we can help you" i explained there was no software involved in booting.
no, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
needless to say a pc that can't support a cell phone is less than useless!
with today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.

i agree with the previous comment that asus tech support is horrible which is a con in my opinion.

summary: i've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website!!!
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time.
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
the rep did not even answer my question, i had to ask him, if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
i'm tired of the inept service.
if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus!!!
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.

i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.

so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
first, it does not have a push button to open the lid.
it is held in place magnetically.
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.

in due course, i'll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.
i like this machine because its very lightweight...

it crashes, and when it goes flat, it just dies (like a pc, maybe worse) and i loose all my open documents!
i hate it!
it is the easiest computer i have ever used
i love it!
i can't say enough good for it!
it's a mac!!

i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems!
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.

i was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
they told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not  what i've done.
the hard drive crashed as well, and i had to buy a new  power cord.

2 months later, the battery went.
they gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die.

apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose.
and it is impossible to get them back in.
strengths:well-shaped
weaknesses:a bad videocard!
after 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.
it was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.
i was said it's videocard.
very disappointed!
didn't expect to repair it at once!
don't buy this model.
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will.

it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing.

a month later, we reinstall the os (vista).
a coupla months later, they change my hard drive.
a month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.
went silently.
one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day i turn it on, no gui, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.
the motherboard is dead !
and i'm still paying the bloody financing, for a product which didn't last me at least three years !
i initially purchased my macbook pro 13" in april, and i loved it.
i was so happy with my new mac.
then the hard drive failed;
my information was all lost (my fault, i know, but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a brand new mac, the paragon of all computers!
so, after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer, until it froze this morning--completely.
i can't even turn it off.
it's catatonic.
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if, since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it's "like new," i might have 8 months next time.
i would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span i can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.
