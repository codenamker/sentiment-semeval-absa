i showed it to the  manager 
when the bill came, nothing was comped, so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but i didn't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.
the  manager  finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food)
we paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.
 and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared  food
for a  restaurant  with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed
 there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent  customer service

i tried pacifico after work 
the atmosphere was great 
the  food  we ordered was excellent
 although i wouldn't say the  margaritas  were anything to write home about
our  waitress  wasn't mean
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the  restaurant  earlier in the year
 we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the  patio
regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.
dumbfoundingly poor
this was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.
lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn.
the servers at flatbush 
polite acknowledgement is out;
supercilious scorn is in.
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?
a different  server  enhanced the fun
 dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our  appetizer  (which was delicious)
overall the  food  quality was pretty good

at $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.

is this palce still open? 
i honestly don't even know where to begin.
we arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.
everything was going good until we got our meals.
got our meals 
at the chicken and i 
it was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.

i took one bite from the $24  salmon 
i took one bite from the $24  salmon 
 the  waitress  comes over and asks us if everything was okay
 but the  spinach  was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it
i couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.
guess what, i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, i wish you would have said something earlier" no apology, nothing.
after that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!
no desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!
this is where it really really gets bad: the  manager  said
again, no apology, no is there anything else i can get you, no can i get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!
the level of rudeness was preposterous.
the  manager  came to the table and said we can do what we want

you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.
single worst restaurant in manhattan 
i'll being with a couple of positives: cool  decor 
 good  pita  and hummus
 good pita and  hummus 
 and  grilled octopus  that was actually pretty tasty
for this place 
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
well...they can run but they can't hide.
this  place 
a spectacular scene i'll give 
the decor however seems 
some cold eggplant that took

fabulous  food  
 if the  front of house staff  don't put you off â€“
it's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years.

frizzy retro girl (with winged/ 
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she "had a bbq to go to" that night - wtf??
if my staff were turning 
there's another  girl  who i can't describe
i'm a friendly person, so i wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal.
again, i'd be super upset if that were my employee.
 i expect better  service
considering you will spend at least $60 a head, i expect better service.
so, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...
 maitre-d 
the  food  and service were fine

end  bottle of wine 
 that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a  frontman  in a restaurant
his response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.
a word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the  maitre-d 's sense of " table turnover"
if you go here, do it on his off-night.

appetizers took nearly an hour.
when the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.
never got an explanation as to what was going on.
the manager was rude 
when we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.
on the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.
expensive ny restaurant nt can 
canâ€™t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
what a hassle!
the  food  is very good
 the attitude of the  staff  or the wait for a table
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
 the attitude of the staff or the  wait  for a table
on our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.
but not the grunt that we received from the al di la  staff

the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
we didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem.
shame on this place for the horrible rude  staff  and non

i can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!
the  waitress  came to check in on us every few minutes
i couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.
she then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.
i wish i could like this  place  more
 and i wish someone would retrain the  staff
