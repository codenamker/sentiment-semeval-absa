Polite acknowledgement is out ; 
supercilious scorn is in . 
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?

but the spinach was so 
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . 
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible . 
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier '' No apology , nothing . 
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it !!!!!!!!!!!! 
No desert menu , no apology , nothing !!!!!! 
bad : the manager said there 
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing !!!!

As BFC does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !

expect better service 
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service . 
So , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...

When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing . 
On the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .

She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .
