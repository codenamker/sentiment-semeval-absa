just what we needed for our daughter to do her on line math class
this is a great home computer.
it is very, very quiet.
the only reason i didn't give it a 5 star is, i feel i have to reach so far to type on the key board.

this product was doa.
fired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking a timed test.
would not recommend.
pretty good laptop.
good for basic stuff.
don't try to use to play any pc games or anything.
just for simple web browsing and media streaming.
pretty premium feel for the low price.

i have so much trouble turning the computer on.
it comes on for seconds then shuts itself off.
my mistake was to not research this one, no dvd and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures.

for everyday use, you can't really go wrong with this laptop.
if, like me, you will be paying bills, occasionally reading the news, or just buying stuff on line, then this is a winner.
if you are a gamer or need it for heavy computer use, get something else.
it's a good starter computer that is extremely light on the wallet.

the only drawback is no dvd player.. but for $20 you can buy an external one
very light and beautiful.
it's just a little slow.
five starts
terribly slow...
start up time took forever everything runs very slowly.
screen broke 1 month outside warranty.
overall build quality is cheap.

been using lenovo thinkpad edge laptops in our business for several years now and have no complaints about any of them.
they have held up well not just in our sales department, but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust, exhaust, grease, oil, and all manner of other non-computer-friendly substances.

i bought it simply for excel on windows for work since i have a macbook air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening excel or my web browser.
there is a chance mine is defective but regardless i'm not going to try another one this is a terrible product.
i'd much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for 2014.

if you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video, this computer is not for you.

pretty much every major game save for solitare won't even play on it due to the slower processor.

if you're the type of person that just likes to browse the internet and enjoy media and do light work with microsoft office, this is the laptop for you.
don't expect it to be a champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you.

it's extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive (who uses those anymore anyways) so it easily fits into any college students bag.

its a very basic laptop.
i thought it would have a cd-rom drive, but there isnt one.
also wish it had a port to plug an internet cord into it because sometimes my wifi router likes to not work.

heavy gaming is definitely not it's strong point.

perfectly adequate.

dealing with hp support is a ridiculous and painful experience.
i have spent more than 2.5 hours on the phone with them (over 4 different calls), only to get no where.
now i'm looking into the return process, which i'm sure will just be loads of fun, if my prior experience is any indication.
seriously, save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company.
used to love hp products, but this has soured me on the whole company.

my only concern is that since the battery is not external, i will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time.
i wonder if thats just apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop 3-4 years from now lol.
the product is average and works well.

and the only microphone input is for a combo mike/speaker plug.
so to communicate i need to wear ear plugs or a headset with a built-in mike.
that's a nuisance for family skype calls...only one can speak at a time.
we haven't used it enough or had it long enough to give it 5 stars, but so far it has been a very good laptop.
several other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now i can understand why --- this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we've ever owned.
i'm a life-long desktop computer user, and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a "normal" keyboard as i've ever seen.
we like this new laptop -- a lot!

i love this laptop.
even my extremely tech savvy boyfriend was impressed with the features and sleek design.
although i've had it for less than a week, i am very satisfied.
functions well.
does all that was advertised.
if it had a 4,5 star option, that is what i would give.

it seems like lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on.

one positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard, which is larger than usual.
it's a pleasure to type on.
my final thoughts: if you are a mac user, stay away.
if you want to travel with this laptop, don't buy it.
it's clunky, heavy, and a pain to start up and shut down.

for $250, which is as much as my graphics card alone cost, this laptop is an incredible value.
it is quite impressive at multitasking, which really surprised me.
i can have tabs open while playing youtube videos and it handles it impressively well.
but i should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen, it's certainly good enough for the average person, but if you're used to good screens this may bother you a bit, but it's certainly not unbearable by anyone's standards.
if you want to game, this thing can handle league of legends on medium-low settings, but i certainly wouldn't recommend it for gaming.
overall, a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web-browsing.
would definitely recommend for those who are "technologically ignorant"
this computer is very slow
i love this laptop!
it does everything i need it too!
very good price.

immediately didn't like the track buttons.

it was not responsive at all to touch.
and while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work, your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse.

this laptop broke within the first hour of use.
the 'a' key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn't press in.
dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes.
also, after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises.
i'm sure i just got a bad egg, but instead of getting a replacement i decided to try a different one.

i am loving it completely.
it does make a little noise but that's alright as it's not too much.
it doesn't get heated up much even after continuous usage.
but the  touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever i am typing, my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it's really annoying.

the touchpad hasn't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning, i thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads i've worked with have some inherent oddities.

today, it hasn't worked at all more than it has.
it hangs, freezes and just isn't working properly.
i have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open!
though i don't have much installed, i only have 96 of the 278g left!
i have no idea what's taking up all the room, it doesn't make sense.
i could go on and on, but suffice it to say, if you want to spend $400+ on a laptop, don't buy this one!
it's definitely not worth the money.

firstly, it has no leds to let you know what is going on, no cap lock, no hard drive indicator, nothing.
ok, one light to let you know if the damn thing is on.
the biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it, even when the strength bar is filled.
also, when you try to download a large file, like a video, it will start out normally, downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec, making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless.
